        <h1>Sri Lankan Leopard</h1>
        <p>The Sri Lankan leopard (Panthera pardus kotiya) is a distinctive subspecies of the leopard native to the island of Sri Lanka, situated in the Indian Ocean. Renowned for its striking appearance and elusive nature, this leopard is characterized by its golden-yellow coat adorned with prominent dark spots and rosettes. The fur is often thicker and shorter than that of other leopard subspecies, possibly an adaptation to the warm tropical climate of Sri Lanka.

            Habitat-wise, the Sri Lankan leopard is highly adaptable and can be found in various ecosystems, including dense rainforests, dry grasslands, and the rugged hills of the central highlands. However, due to habitat loss and fragmentation, their populations are now primarily concentrated in protected areas such as Yala National Park, Wilpattu National Park, and Horton Plains National Park.
            
            This leopard is a solitary and predominantly nocturnal predator, preying on a diverse range of animals, including deer, wild boar, and monkeys. It is an apex predator in its ecosystem, playing a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance.
            
            Despite its significance in Sri Lanka's biodiversity, the Sri Lankan leopard faces numerous threats, including habitat destruction, human-wildlife conflict, and poaching. Conservation efforts are underway to protect these magnificent creatures and their habitats, emphasizing the importance of coexistence between humans and wildlife to ensure the survival of this iconic species.</p>

            <h2>Horton Plains National Park </h2>
            <p>Finding a leopard (Panthera pardus kotiya) at the Horton Plains National Park was extremely difficult before 2021. The 'process of habituation' (being accustomed or used to something) took place after 2021 when a female leopard got habituated and birthed three cubs here and the cubs got habituated through their mother..</p>

            <h2>Kumana National Park</h2>
            <p>Kumana National Park has been an incredible stronghold for Sri Lankan Leopards (Panthera pardus kotiya). The park is adjoining Kudumbigala Sanctuary and Yala Block 2, providing further habitats for leopards to extend their behavioral landscape.</p>
