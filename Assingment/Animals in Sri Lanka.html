    <p style="margin-top: -5px;">
        Sri Lanka, an island nation in South Asia, boasts a rich diversity of wildlife, with a wide array of animals inhabiting its varied ecosystems. The country's unique geographical features, including lush rainforests, dry plains, and coastal regions, contribute to the remarkable biodiversity found within its borders.

Sri Lanka is renowned for its numerous species of mammals, including the elusive Sri Lankan leopard, which is the apex predator and a symbol of the country's wildlife conservation efforts. Other notable mammals include elephants, sloth bears, sambar deer, and various monkey species like the toque macaque and purple-faced langur.

The avian diversity in Sri Lanka is equally impressive, with a plethora of bird species inhabiting its wetlands, forests, and coastal areas. The country is a haven for birdwatchers, featuring species such as the Sri Lankan junglefowl, which is the national bird, as well as colorful parrots, eagles, and a variety of water birds.

Sri Lanka's waters are teeming with marine life, including dolphins, whales, and diverse fish species. The surrounding oceans provide a vital habitat for marine turtles, with several species nesting on the country's sandy shores.

Conservation initiatives and national parks, such as Yala National Park and Wilpattu National Park, play a crucial role in preserving Sri Lanka's unique fauna. Despite the challenges of habitat loss and human-wildlife conflict, the country remains committed to protecting its diverse animal life, making it a compelling destination for wildlife enthusiasts and nature lovers alike.</p>
